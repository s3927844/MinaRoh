<p>Hi! I am Mina and live in Melbourne. I am a wife and mum of two little girls.
I currently work for 4 days and try to make a balance between caring
responsibilities, housework, study and work to manage time efficiently.
Even though I am a mature student after completing a bachelor of an
architectural engineering long time ago, I am so excited to start my new
 course which is the bachelor of Information.
</p>
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p>I am interested in coding, programming, ai, vr, cyber security and
   cloud architecture and my interest started when I studied the big
    technology company for the investment in US stock market. I realized how the IT companies affected the all over the world and change all the systems greatly.
  I can’t wait for the significant changes in the coming fourth revolution. Even though I
  do not have enough knowledge and information in relation to IT field currently, I would like to contribute one of person who can achieve technology based
  innovation
  after my graduation. When I complete a course in RMIT, I would like to achieve all the required knowledge and skills which are enough to become an IT
    profession.
</p>

<h2> A particular event and person that sparked my interest </h2>
<p>Even though I don’t have any particular experiences in IT field,
  I have sparked by many factors. First of all, one of my friends
  who is my role model encouraged me in a various way by explaining
   her amazing career background and an interesting program created
   by her. Whenever I listened to her story, it was so good to hear in regards
    to work with balance and welfare in the IT Company. Secondly, I was inspired by many articles and it demonstrates that a wide range of 
  job groups will disappear within 10 years but new occupation will be created or increased, 80% of which are related to IT field. Lastly, 
  I was motivated by Elon Musk who is the CEO of Space X and early stage investor and CEO of Tesla. He is a great adventurer who creates legend
  in the electric car field and aerospace area. The autonomous driving and aerospace technology showed to the world fascinated me.
    I don't have such a natural talent or genius brain, but I want to become a person who can contribute even a little to such a changed world 
  by looking at such people. Even if I might fail in studying or getting a job, I want to take a step forward and challenge myself.</p>

<h2> Why RMIT? </h2>
<p>RMIT is the one of best university is famous for IT and
  I believe that through the course provided by RMIT, I can develop my
   knowledge and skills in relation to IT field. I believe that
    technology in RMIT is world renowned and it provides diverse curriculum and
     strong industry connection to make it a great opportunity. </p>

<h2> Expectation </h2>
<p>I expect to learn a wide range of programming and coding
  skills and specialized knowledge enough to acquire an IT profession
  career. I can expect to improve comprehending of programming languages
   and information systems and technology which can develop abilities to
    solve problems. I would like to be a prepared worker who can adopt
    all the required skills and knowledge that can apply for the
    incredible innovation.</p>
