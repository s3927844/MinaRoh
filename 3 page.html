    <h2> The results of test </h2>
    <p> MBTI provides me time to understand strengths and weaknesses
       of my personality. I learned about myself how I was different
       from others. I also wondered when I saw the consequences of
       having a lot of thoughts on myself and being conflicted and
        complex within myself. It is exactly me to describe.
        The MBTI results also informed me of the suitable job and
        unsuitable job with my personality, and one of the proper jobs
        for my personality was the UX designer and software developer.
         I was so excited to have the results and I felt that this course
          is just right for me. And some of the unsuitable jobs included
           the occupation I currently work in.
            It provided a valuable time for me to understand why
            I wanted to change current jobs and struggled with myself.</p>

     <h2> Influence of test results in a team </h2>
     <p>The results of personality test showed that I am positive
       and capable co-workers.
This ability can affect to provide motivation and solve problems without
 conflicts.
The results showed that I am dedicated and hard-working.
Even though I have great strengths, my test results INTJ are
not considered to become leaders. It is a true that I always love to
support the other team workers as a quiet person. I don’t prefer to
 get spotlight from others.
</p>

<h2> Consideration when foaming a team</h2>
<p> I will consider that when I foam the group that I can gather a
  team who would like to become a leader and will explain that I can
   be the one who can dedicatedly support teams. To make a balance in
   the team, if it is possible, the features of introvert and extravert
   people might congregate to make the best performance. I have great
   strength which can possibly care people to have a good relationship,
    so I will try to take good care of other’s feeling to become a good
     team. </p>
