       This role is responsible for protecting the safety of
       IT infrastructure and networks from any risks. For example,

        Twitch recently reported that streamers' earnings and other important information were disclosed. Information leakage occurs on websites where hackers are mainly active. Twitch's hacking incident brings the cyber security industry to the attention once again. As cloud industry and digitalization is rising at a rapid pace, cyber security issue can be occurred. For these reasons, as the demand of the cyber security industry is increasing, I am interested in the cyber security job as the profession. </p>
