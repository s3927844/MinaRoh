        <h2> Overview </h2>
<p>The project is a smart baby mobile program for newborn babies.
   Infants are
  required a lot of help from adults because they cannot solve
  their desires alone. In order to solve this problem, a smart
  mobile is installed on the baby's cot and the sensor is designed
   to detect various functions such as temperature, humidity, air
   quality, child temperature, and baby’s discomfort and so on. In
    addition, the modules attached to the smart mobile allow parents
     to identify the environment of the space in which the baby lives,
     collect information, and provide control and convenience functions
      through the application.</p>
<h2> Motivation</h2>
<p>The project will be useful to prevent sudden infant death
   syndrome (SIDS) and SIDS refers a child’s sudden and
   unexpected death. The mortality rate for babies in 2017
    in Australia is 6 deaths per live 100000 babies. And majority deaths happens between one and three months age The project is designed that smart mobiles would be helpful to reduce any risks of the death of babies. Apart from this, parents who are in difficulty with parenting can also have benefits to be able to check child’s discomfort through various functions provided by smart mobile to meet the needs of their children. </p>
<h2> Description</h2>
<p>This product informs by measuring the air quality, temperature
   and humidity of the space in which a baby stays and checking the
    baby's body temperature. And there is a variety of music,
    including lullaby that is needed when the baby sleeps, and
    nursery rhymes that can be heard when the baby plays.
    In addition, songs can be changed through the application
     and the mobile itself also allows users to change the
     songs they want freely through the buttons. The toy on
     the mobile also has a colour variation, such as a black-and-white
      and a coloured mobile, depending on the child's development,
       and the rotating direction can also be controlled.
In addition, the brightness of the lights is also adjusted via the
application or mobile itself and the light can be automatically on
when the baby wakes up or cry when you set the function.
Furthermore, with a camera attached to the mobile, users can see
their babies on a real-time basis through the app and save photos or
videos if users want. And when the baby cries, it is automatically
 set to be known through the app, and it provides information to
 users about the meaning of crying sound. It can analyse reasons why
 baby cries because of hunger, boring or the need of changing
 nappies or tiredness.
Another feature is that the app allows users to record their
voices such as kind words of parents or songs or story books
that the baby needs are transmitted to the baby through the
 mobile speakers to provide a sense of comfort even when the
  baby is surprised and scared to sleep alone in a room.
And other services in the app provide the ability to write down a
 child's routine, such as the child's developmental situation, the number
  of feedings, and the time they sleep. It will also provide journals
   to write down parents' feelings, providing valuable space for users
    to see their children’s development, photos, videos, and parental
     feelings.

The app also provides developmental levels and indicators to check
 their children’s average body size, language, emotions, cognition,
  and sociality according to the developmental stage of that age.
  It is possible to see if the child is growing well according to
   the stage by looking at the characteristics of the infant
   development stage provided.

The limitation of this project is that the period of use of the
 baby mobile is short. As babies grow, physical development occurs,
  which means they can break, move or drop the baby mobile by touching
   it while they grow physically. And as the mobile is a passive toy,
    it may not help the baby's independent movements and sensations
    as well. And since the baby's development is checked through the
    smart mobile, the sense of interaction with the
     parents may decrease. And sometimes, depending on the baby's
      preference, the baby may dislike or be afraid of the baby
      mobile that is attached to the baby cot, and the another limitation
       is that it may be difficult to install a smart mobile in a
        house if they do not have a baby crib.
</p>

<h2> Tools and Technologies </h2>
<p>For creating application, it would be available through Android Studio.
The program has google's various services and templates that support
 different device types, allowing it to automatically generate basic
 code files for the project.

 For CCTV attached to the mobile, video streaming using MJPG streamers
 from the Raspberry Pi is required. MJPG Streamer is a solution (MJPG)
  that performs jpg shooting continuously and makes it look like a
   video. After a series of installations, it acts as an HTTP Server
    that can be accessed by a specific port. This page allows users
    to view MJPG videos, so it can be accessible to view them in a
    browser.
It is also available through Raspberry Pi to make stream and record
music.  It can create a music streaming server to stream music files
 from the raspberry pi from the outside.</p>

<h2> Skills </h2>
<p>A variety of skills are necessary to work on this project. It is
required to have knowledge of HTML and CCS for building web and apps.
It is necessary to understand the tool called Android Studio and
 knowledge of a program called Raspberry PI. And it would be also required
 to comprehend the computer language JAVA. In addition, hardware
  requires a remote control device, a thermometer, wireless adjustment
   toy, etc. that can be used to create smart mobiles. Sensors and
    lights that can detect baby movements and bluetooth capabilities
     that can connect to each other are likely to be required.</p>
<h2> Outcome </h2>

<p> This smart mobile can effect to reduce risks of SIDS in newborn
   babies by providing various services. It can offer a wide range of
    conveniences and benefits to parents who are new of caring
    responsibilities or experience difficulties in parenting,
    providing convenience in caring for children. In addition,
    this smart mobile will be great help to parents with
     postpartum depression by providing innovative services.
     They can check the status of the child in real time and know
     answers of why the child is crying, and provide the best service
      for their children. Also, it may be able to relieve the anxiety
       that arises in the mind of parents caused by caring for a
       child</p>
